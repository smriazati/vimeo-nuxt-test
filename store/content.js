            <h2>Creative Team</h2>

            <h3>Noelia R. Deza</h3>
            <h4>Role in project</h4>
            <p>Noelia R. Deza is a screenwriter/director, editor and producer from Madrid, Spain. She has completed studies at ECAM (Madrid), EICTV (Cuba) and, thanks to scholarships from la Caixa and SGAE, Columbia University School of the Arts (New York), where she obtained a Master in Fine Arts. Her films have been selected and awarded at festivals such as DocumentaMadrid, DOKLeipzig, Tribeca Film Festival, FICUNAM Mexico, Beijing ISVF, FTII India and Malaga Film Festival among others. Noelia’s work is rooted in traditions of naturalism and slow cinema which, combined with her minimalist mise en scène, creates sensorily rich cinematographic worlds that blur the line between fiction and nonfiction.
            Noelia’s short film, Formol, was chosen as an official selection in more than seventy festivals including DOK Leipzig and FICUNAM Mexico, collecting awards at DocumentaMadrid, FTII India, Short Stories Argentina and AIFI Sicily. Her feature film script, Under Glass, won the Alfred P. Sloan Award and was nominated for the Sloan Grand Prize at the Tribeca Film Festival. That Summer, We Stayed at Home was selected in the Official Short Film Section of the 23rd Malaga Film Festival. Her first feature film as director and screenwriter, Gravity and Grace, is currently in development. <a href=" http://rionortefilms.com/about-robert-kerr-noelia-deza/" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
            <h3>Lou Tides</h3>
            <h4>Role in project</h4>
            <p>Lou Tides is a producer, composer, and performer. Her work examines the relationship between emotion, the body, shape, and how each of these factors collaborate. Set to encourage further questioning, the work does not aim to answer; the intent is to evaluate the relationship between questioning and growth. Can it separate ourselves from our conditioning? Our privilege? Pain? How can one body hold so much?  
            Using light and movement to create shape and personify sound/song, the questioning is further maximized in how conditioning (or even deeper, trauma) sets and resets; recharging itself in loops of circular motion, creating habitude. Fracturing into dualism, transformation, and the idea of each body containing multitudes, the work aims to explore these circular motions, and create systems of acceleration and acknowledgement. At times, breaking the loop, returning to the loop, and connecting both, to move towards metamorphosis. Emotion as net force, the body as the outer sphere, the movement of the body collaborates with the movement of emotion in a controlled chaos and as vessel for transformation. 
            Aesthetically, Lou Tides embraces both classic entertainment and spacial gesture, finding joy in the interaction between vaudevillian humor and repetitive, statuesque movement. Inspired by artists such as Harpo Marx and Lindsay Kemp, Lou Tides enjoys simplicity, theatrics, and the use of costume, posing the question - “does removal of self get me one step closer to transformation?”</p>
